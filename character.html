                    The Arrow Retrieval Journey
                </h3>

                        As is well known, Apollo is held in high regard by all the archers of the land. Because of this, many a tournament was held in his honor in order to discover the finest archer in the land. One fateful day, however, a young man, skilled beyond belief, quietly entered into the royal tournament for King Philip II of Macedon. In this tournament, the archer was, without question, the most skilled participant. In fact, the young man was so skilled that some in the crowd began to murmur that he could rival Apollo himself. Apollo, ever filled with pride, was outraged to hear such murmurings.
                         Here he was, at a tournament in his honor, and he was being talked about like he was some second-rate archer. Well, in an effort to put a stop to this, Apollo forced the young man's winning arrow to veer wildly off course, shooting it straight into, of course, the sun. Knowing that the arrow had no chance of hitting its mark, Apollo chuckled to himself, pleased with his efforts, and sauntered away. Unbeknownst to Apollo, the young man's skill and appearance had drawn the gaze of the Khione, the snow goddess and daughter of the God of the North Wind. Seeing an opportunity to win the mortal
                         over, Khione freezes time and offers him the chance for his arrow to come back down into the target and win the tournament, but he must prove his worth and pass her trials. Confident in his ability, our hero says yes. Khione lays out 5 trials he must complete. One for each of the main elements, then an additional one for the best of them all, ice. The wind and water challenges prove easy, as our hero can account for wind while using his bow and has been using it fish since he was a boy. The earth challenge, while difficult, results in our hero discovering how to turn his arrows into grapple lines
                         in order to cross wide chasms. As for the fire challenge, he barely escapes with his life, and loses his trusty bow in the process. The goddess believes this will mean the end of the trials, but our hero surprises her and volunteers to do it anyway. Surprised by this, she fashions a bow and quiver out of the finest, non-melting ice and presents it to our hero. This, he learns, was the final quest, the ice quest. He had couried her favor and would now be able to both win the contest and get the girl, all he had to do was tell her his name. Without much pomp or circumstance, our hero simply replies, "Ferb."

                    Alexander vs. Ares 
                </h3>

                        This story will be short and to the point, as is everything with Ares. The less you have to talk, the more you can focus on fighting, even if much of warfare starts with the mind. Interestingly, there isn't much to this story that isn't already well-known. Alexander the Great was considered a master of warfare and one of the greatest generals ever. However, his fame eventually grew too large to be ignored by the gods. As a boy, Ares had favored the child. Granted him gifts of vision, of knowledge, of quick-learning, but the boy had not paid his respects as he should have to the god of war, and this did not sit well with Ares. However, the mortal was far too beloved by the other gods for a simple act of obliteration to suffice. No, he would need to make this look like self-sabotage. 
                        The moment presented itself whenever Alexander had finished his conquest of the Persian Empire. His army, far from home and exhausted, had finally finished their wars and wrapped up to head home. Due to their fatigue, a few of the generals got into an argument with Alexander about the course they should take and where they should go next. Seeing this, Ares took the opportunity to cripple the young genius's army forever by swaying his mind and forcing him to cross an inhospitable desert on the way home. Despite this not being necessary Alexander forced his men into the desert and lost a large portion of his fighting force in addition to falling ill. Due to these rough circumstances, the young emperor would succumb to his condition not many years later, thus marking the end of another 
                        of Ares's enemies and the reinforcement of the idea that it is important to thank those who helped you get where you are today.

                    The Trojan Seahorse
                </h3>

                        As this is the third story I am typing I am tired of typing. This is the story of the trojan horse, but it is the original. Many think that the battle and subsequent trickery at Troy was the first time that the horse trick had been used, but this is not entirely correct. It was first used long before man existed by Poseidon to sneak into the fortress of and defeat the titan of the sea, Oceanus. 
                        No, I am not joking, that is his actual name, the Greeks are not very creative when it comes to niche characters in their stories. Regardless, he did the whole horse schtick and ended up overthrowing the titan. Now he rules the waves and has a son who gets into a ton of trouble and somehow never seems to run into a god or monster that can kill him which seems very implausible but it's whatever.
